# ESOPie
ESOPie is a radial action-binding addon inspired by the WoW addon [OPie by cfxfox](https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/opie).

ESOPie provides up to 6 bindings to display rings of up to 12 usable slots much like the Quickslot feature with sub-rings that can be used to create a deep tree of options.
